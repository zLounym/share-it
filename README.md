# shareIT
shareIT is BE application for learning and sharing knowledge.

You can create profile where you put your skills and level of that skill and your interests (skills you want to learn). After somebody will add skill you wanna learn system will send notification to your email. You can as well match with people by searching for desired skill or people.

### Current state

Application was spinned up during Twill POWER UP Hackathon which lasted only for two days. So the app is very much WIP and as well you need to understand the reason why no tests are included. It was not possible to write them as I was the only BE in our team.
